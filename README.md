*DESCRIPTION* :

The above Java program implements a basic user-based recommendation system using Apache Mahout, a machine learning library. It begins by importing the necessary classes from the Mahout library for working with user data, calculating similarity, defining neighborhoods, and generating recommendations. In the main method, the program first loads user-item preference data from a CSV file named dataset.csv. This file is expected to have three columns: user ID, item ID, and the user's rating or preference for that item. The FileDataModel class is used to read and model this data for further processing.

Next, the program calculates how similar each pair of users are using the Pearson Correlation Similarity measure. This similarity metric helps in identifying users with similar preferences based on how they rate items. After computing similarities, the program defines a user neighborhood by selecting the two users most similar to the target user. This is done using the NearestNUserNeighborhood class, which filters out only the top-N similar users, in this case, two.

With the neighborhood defined, the program creates a recommender using the GenericUserBasedRecommender class, which takes the data model, similarity measure, and neighborhood as inputs. This recommender system then generates recommendations for a specific user. In this example, it generates the top three item recommendations for the user with ID 3. The recommendations are generated by analyzing what similar users have liked and suggesting those items that the target user hasn't yet rated.

Finally, the program prints out the recommended item IDs along with their corresponding recommendation scores, which reflect the strength of the recommendation. Any errors during this process, such as issues with reading the file or data formatting problems, are caught and printed to the console. This program demonstrates a simple but effective approach to building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering.

*OUTPUT* : 

Recommendations for User 3:

Item: 102 | Score: 4.116

Item: 103 | Score: 3.321

Item: 105 | Score: 3.104
